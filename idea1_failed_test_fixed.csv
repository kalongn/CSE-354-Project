[CLS] [TGT] suggested february 5 that congress faces a march 5 deadline for dealing with the 690 000 daca illegals even though the deadline has been vaporized by a california court. [TGT] cited the non - existent deadline in a tweet [TGT] posted after democrats announced on sunday they had rejected [TGT] four - part amnesty and immigration framework plan. the tweet is one of several recent occasions where [TGT] has claimed that the march 5 date is a deadline. the march 5 deadline appeared in september when attorney general jeff sessions admitted the illegality of former president barack obama ’ s daca amnesty. [TGT] chose to wind down the daca program by directing that the lower officials not extend the two - year work permits given to the daca illegals. business groups have touted the march 5 deadline because they are rushing congress to legally preserve the daca program. they want the amnesty preserved to keep the 690 000 daca people in the labor market but also to deny [TGT] any political leverage that he could use to force congress to accept a broader rewrite of immigration laws that would reduce the inflow of new workers and consumers each year.

[CLS] [TGT] speaks to members of the media after [TGT] returned to the white house from florida on september 14th 2017. ( photo : alex wong / getty images ) but that coverage comes at a cost. [TGT] is hardly the only important political actor. congress gets far less attention even if it is the body actually developing most of the national policies that will affect americans. state and local governments get paltry coverage in comparison although the work they do has the most direct effect on our daily lives. this seems particularly relevant in the [TGT] era. even by presidential standards [TGT] is unusually successful in drawing media coverage. [TGT] gets coverage for the usual things presidents doaforeign travel addresses and rallies bill signings etc. abut also for tweets and incendiary statements most other presidents simply never made. yet newspapers aren't getting bigger and 24 - hour news channels can't add additional hours to their days. are other stories losing out? now there are plausible causes for this trend other than [TGT]'s attention - grabbing behavior. it's possible the issue just isn't as salient now because it's seen as an ongoing matter rather than a new one. it's possible the issue drew more attention in the recent past because barack obama as an african american was expected to do more to address the issue of police killings of black citizens. nonetheless the trend is consistent with the idea that more coverage of trump leads to less coverage of everything else. a concern expressed repeatedly by observers of the trump presidency is that most of the crises he has faced have been of his own making. how will he behave once he faces a challenge of office that he didn't create? in fact he's been facing challenges all along. the killing of unarmed civilians by police officers remains a serious crisis as does north korea opioid abuse climate change flooding and other matters. to the extent trump has an approach to dealing with such crises it seems to be to draw attention away from them.

[TGT] pointed out at the time that five taliban leaders were freed from guantanamo so that bergdahl could be released from captivity. to gild the lily national security adviser susan rice said bergdahl served “ the united states with honor and distinction. ” [TGT] had all of this information at his disposal before he made a deal releasing bergdahl. why then did he mislead the american people? the answer can be found in the president ’ s desire to satisfy antiwar liberals keen on emptying gitmo. at the rose garden event [TGT] admitted as much when [TGT] said “ we ’ re committed to winding down the war in afghanistan and closing gitmo. ” it is instructive that the cia has evidence at least three of the released taliban leaders have returned to the battlefield. one intelligence official argued : “ it ’ s probably a tie as to who is the bigger traitor ” – bergdahl or [TGT]. the president ’ s dissimulation clearly violated the military code and has had a profound effect on morale. those i know in the military invariably ask how a president could honor a deserter when he was fully aware of his prior actions. this of course wasn ’ t the first time president obama allowed politics to determine a course of ethical behavior but it may be among the most egregious examples. one intelligence official argued : “ it ’ s probably a tie as to who is the bigger traitor ” – bergdahl or [TGT]. with a political ecology in which standards have been debased many have attempted to rationalize president obama ’ s decision. in my judgment however his actions that jeopardized national security should be fully investigated and where blame exists the full weight of public opinion should be employed to condemn the president and his assistants.

"[CLS] republicans in congress are nowhere near coming together around any plan to address gun violence nearly two weeks after a school shooting in florida left 17 dead and despite [TGT] ’ s promises to take action. returning to washington monday after a week on recess republicans were divided on a slew of proposals [TGT] has raised and some questioned whether any reforms are needed at all. “ i don ’ t think we need more gun control ” louisiana sen. john kennedy told reporters monday. “ i think we need better idiot control. ” trump who has been talking to congressional republicans and lobbyists from the national rifle association in recent days has proposed a broad range of ideas during listening sessions and in tweets including increasing the age requirement for purchasing certain types of guns arming some teachers making changes to the background check system reopening mental institutions and banning bump stocks through the department of justice. the white house is scheduled to host a bipartisan group of lawmakers wednesday to come up with a path forward on some of those ideas. “ we continue to mourn the loss of so many precious young lives ” trump said monday. “ these are incredible people. i visited with a lot of them. but we ’ ll turn our grief into action. ” while the media campaign from the young survivors of the parkland shooting has kept up the pressure on lawmakers to act many republicans are still reluctant to push significant changes to gun policy and challenge the nra which has five million members — the majority of whom live in conservative districts. in a room with several republican governors trump said monday not to worry about the influential group. "" you guys — half of you are so afraid of the nra ” he said. “ there's nothing to be afraid of. and you know what if they're not with you we have to fight them every once in a while. that's ok.

[TGT] is supposed to be working on preventing another government shutdown and negotiating a bipartisan agreement on immigration policy. instead [TGT] joshing about democrats committing treason for failing to applaud his speech to trumpas satisfaction? but even for those inclined to shrug off the atreasona talk trumpas point wasnat subtle : he believes democrats are lacking in patriotism. indeed the atreasona references stood out but note that the president also used phrases such as aun - americana and athey certainly didnat seem to love our country very much. a the irony is [TGT] surrendered the high ground on patriotism quite a while ago. as regular readers know this president is a poor messenger for this message.

[CLS] washington ( reuters ) - u. s. president [TGT] and mexican president enrique pena nieto postponed plans for the mexican leaderas first visit to the white house after a testy phone call involving trumpas push for a border wall a senior u. s. official said on saturday. mexican officials had been talking about a summit between trump and pena nieto in the next few weeks without specifying when. the washington post which first reported the delay earlier on saturday said the two leaders spoke for about 50 minutes on tuesday. but the discussion led to an impasse when trump would not agree to publicly affirm mexicoas position that it would not fund construction of the wall along the u. s. - mexico border. a mexican official said trump lost his temper during the conversation the newspaper reported. but it said u. s. officials described trump as frustrated and exasperated because he believed it was unreasonable for pena nieto to want him to back off his campaign promise of forcing mexico to pay for the wall. mexicoas foreign ministry said it had nothing to say about the call other than a statement on tuesday that said trump had expressed condolences for a helicopter crash in mexico and both sides had committed to advancing the bilateral agenda of trade migration and security. the wall a key item for trumpas political base of supporters has become a sticking point in talks to keep alive a federal program that protects from deportation young people who were brought to the united states illegally as children. in his latest budget proposal to congress trump requested $ 23 billion for border security most of it for building the wall. pena nieto who met trump in july on the sidelines of a g20 summit canceled an earlier meeting after trump threatened to impose a tax on mexican imports to pay for the wall. trump also met the mexican president once during the 2016 election campaign.

[CLS] [TGT] s recently concluded trip to asia had the potential to advance important american security and economic interests. played correctly his ambitious five - country 12 - day trip could have steadied his administration ’ s rocky start in this vital region. instead it left the united states more isolated and in retreat handing leadership of the newly christened “ indo - pacific ” to china on a silver platter. the trip began with solid performances in japan and korea where mr.

[TGT] largely shelved [TGT] belligerent trade rhetoric called for allies to buy more american military hardware and reopened the door to diplomacy with north korea. weather curtailed [TGT] surprise trip to the korean demilitarized zone but that may have been a blessing since hostile words might have prompted hostile action. but in china the wheels began to come off [TGT] diplomatic bus. the chinese leadership played [TGT] like a fiddle catering to [TGT] insatiable ego and substituting pomp and circumstance for substance. china always prefers to couch state visits in ceremony rather than compromise on policy. this approach seemed to suit [TGT] just fine as [TGT] welcomed a rote recitation of china ’ s longstanding rejection of a nuclear north korea and failed to extract new concessions or promises.

[TGT] ranks at no. 2 behind sen. bernie sanders ( i - vt. ) on the fix's list of top 2020 contenders. and speaking of the # metoo movement the buzz around oprah winfrey after her campaign - style speech during the golden globes confirmed that she would beat the president. according to the poll she would get 52 percent of the vote to [TGT]'s 39 percent. but 66 percent of respondents said electing a celebrity as president is a bad idea. one particular lawmaker who is considered a front - runner by many liberals would not appear to have the support needed to beat trump : sanders. when asked whether theyad be inclined to vote for sanders over trump 55 percent of those surveyed said no. it has become a common argument on the left when lamenting [TGT] that had sanders been the democratic nominee over hillary clinton he would have attracted enough support to beat [TGT]. the argument is that liberals who did not back clinton would have voted for sanders along with some of the white working - class voters and men who ultimately chose trump. the survey did not poll americans on other hypothetical 2020 candidates including sen. cory booker ( d - n. j. ) or sen. kamala d. harris ( d - calif. ). but what is clear is that more than half of americans seem uninterested in allowing [TGT] to remain in the white house for another term. in a question in which no opponent is named 62 percent of respondents said that they would not be inclined to vote for [TGT] ; 34 percent said they would.

[TGT] trampled all over those as a candidate a refusing to disclose [TGT] tax returns for example a and has trampled over even more as president. convention dictated that [TGT] had to divest [TGT] of private business concerns on taking office to prevent a conflict of interest a but in the absence of a law explicitly forcing [TGT] to do so [TGT] did no such thing. the same goes for appointing unqualified relatives to senior jobs sacking the director of the fbi with no legitimate cause or endorsing an accused child molester for the us senate. no law told him he couldnat so he did. i once thought the us constitution a a document crafted with almost mathematical precision constructing a near - perfect equilibrium of checks and balances a offered protection against such perils. and thereas no denying that that text as interpreted by the courts has indeed acted as a partial roadblock in trumpas path delaying and diluting his muslim - focused atravel bana for example. but this year of [TGT] has also shown the extent to which the us has an unwritten constitution that a just like ours a relies on the self - restraint of the key political players a self - restraint usually insisted upon by a free press. yet when confronted with a leader unbound by any sense of shame a and shamelessness might just be trumpas defining quality a america is left unexpectedly vulnerable. of course there is a remedy and its name is impeachment. scholars are clear that [TGT] has already provided sufficient legal grounds for such a move a the case against [TGT] is far more compelling than the one against bill clinton. but impeachment proceedings are triggered by the house of representatives followed by a trial in the senate and nothing will happen so long as republicans control both houses of congress. in 2017 we saw with new clarity that the strength of the us constitution depends entirely on [SEP],0,1
"[CLS] brushing past opposition in his own party [TGT] announced agreement with republicans monday night on a plan to extend expiring income tax cuts for all americans renew jobless benefits for the long - term unemployed and grant a one - year reduction in payroll taxes. own party [TGT] announced agreement with republicans monday night on a plan to extend expiring income tax cuts for all americans renew jobless benefits for the long - term unemployed and grant a one - year reduction in payroll taxes. the emerging agreement also includes tax breaks for businesses that [TGT] said would contribute to the economy's recovery from the worst recession in eight decades. [TGT]'s announcement marked a dramatic reversal of [TGT] long - held insistence originally laid out in [TGT] 2008 campaign that tax cuts should only be extended at incomes up to $ 200 000 for individuals and $ 250 000 for couples. [TGT] explained [TGT] about - face by saying that [TGT] still opposed the move and noted the agreement called for a temporary two - year extension of cuts at all income levels not the permanent renewal that republicans have long sought. [TGT] also wanted to wrap up a deal on the tax cuts quickly to leave time for the senate to debate and vote on a new nuclear arms control treaty with russia which [TGT] has made a top year - end priority. both parties have been under pressure from their bases not to compromise on the tax cut issue. republicans insist that it makes no sense to raise taxes on anyone in a weak economy. democrats argue that extending tax cuts for the richest americans would contribute to rising deficits and force deeper cuts in social welfare programs. [TGT] found [TGT] under fire from liberal democrats who accused [TGT] of being too quick to cave in to republican demands. [TGT] said the continued political stalemate over taxes amounted to a "" chilling prospect for the american people whose taxes are currently scheduled to go up on jan. 1. "" [TGT] said there were elements of the deal [TGT] personally opposed including an extension of expiring income tax cuts at upper income levels and the more generous deal on estate taxes. but [TGT] said [TGT] decided that an agreement with republicans was more important than a stalemate that would have resulted in higher income taxes at all levels on jan. 1. even though the newly elected lawmakers don't take their seats until january [TGT] has already treated republican leaders with far more deference than [TGT] has so far in [TGT] term. similarly mcconnell and rep. john boehner of ohio in line to become house speaker have seemed willing to strive for compromise with the white house rather than merely oppose virtually all of the president's initiatives.

[CLS] [TGT] is giving states the green light to increase premiums on enrollees in medicaid the nation's health insurance program for the poor. ( david goldman / ap ) indiana is at the leading edge of republican efforts to shift medicaid in a more conservative direction — with [TGT] giving the green light to states to shift some of the burden for the program onto the poor. indiana began asking the destitute to pay a monthly premium for some medicaid services in 2015 as part of a deal with the obama administration to expand the program. but more recent moves by kentucky maine and wisconsin seeking to ramp up patients'payments do not include a goal of expanding the 53 - year - old program. last month [TGT] approved kentucky ’ s petition to raise premiums and impose work requirements for medicaid. earlier this month [TGT] approved indiana's plan to raise premiums for poor people who smoke tobacco. the new medicaid premiums come at a time when [TGT] is seeking to overhaul the social safety net. conservatives say the changes which give poor people additional responsibilities for obtaining government benefits will encourage them to join the workforce. critics say the requirements will push more people into poverty.

[TGT] is over which federal law prevails in naming an interim director. according to democrats the relevant law is the 2010 dodd - frank wall street reform law that created the cfpb which stipulates that the agencyas deputy director is to take over in the short term. cordray in announcing his resignation on friday said he had named english as deputy director and that she would become the acting director. but administration officials say the 1998 federal vacancies reform act gives the president the power to temporarily fill agency positions except for those with multi - member boards - an exemption they said did not apply to the cfpb. part of the confusion stems from the status of the cfpb as an independent government agency. there are several court challenges underway to that designation which should give trump the power to name an interim replacement. on saturday evening the justice department said in a memo that the white house was right to name a new cfpb director. the dodd - frank language about changing cfpb directors is aunusuala but the white house may name an interim chief according to the memo. such advice from the justice department is open to legal challenge. alan kaplinsky head of the consumer financial services group for law firm ballard spahr llp said the issue will likely have to be decided in the courts. in the meantime he said athis enormous cloud of uncertaintya will hang over the cfpb. kaplinsky said he believes that dodd - frank provides for the deputy director to take charge during the short - term but congress did not explicitly list the resignation of the director as a situation where the deputy would step up. ai think trump wins but unfortunately it is going to take a while a kaplinsky said.

[CLS] president trump speaks on friday at the white house in washington. ( evan vucci / associated press ) with all the noise coming from the president last week ( and the week before that and so far this weeka¦ ) a bit of good news for this embattled white house may be emerging. and if the american body politic doesnat experience a complete meltdown this week perhaps others will notice. the good news is that after having tried everything else the trump team now appears to be cooperating in a normal way with special counsel robert s. mueller iiias investigation. according to a recent new york times report a the presidentas legal team is working swiftly to respond to requests from mr. mueller for emails documents and memos and will make white house officials available for interviews. a itas about time. after months of leaks innuendo willful ignorance and wild speculation nothing has pointed to anything approaching substantive collusion with russia on the part of the president or [TGT]. but the investigation is ongoing and the white house has decided to stop acting as though it is guilty a or at least hiding something a and begin acting as if it is innocent. imagine. since the investigation began paul manafort michael flynn and others have tacitly admitted to foreign agents registration act violations answered questions about this or that meeting or been subject to aggressive moves by muelleras investigative team looking into the financial dealings of some of president trumpas associates. and yet nothing has confirmed a or even suggested a nefarious collusion between russia and [TGT]. these collateral reports are all sideshows used by the media to create the impression that something significant could still arise connecting the [TGT] campaign to russia. but they are just a lot of fog. but in washington being innocent is only an advantage a it is not determinative. democrats in congress and liberals everywhere will refuse to accept muelleras inevitable finding of no collusion. and even as the collusion story fades the mainstream mediaas latest fixation is that somehow russian manipulation of social media ads during the 2016 campaign was significant. but if the media really thinks this issue is a big deal it should be asking where the obama administration was when all this egregious hijacking of american democracy took place. will anyone suggest that the obama administration was to blame and that the former presidentas incompetence led to this problem or will they somehow make the story about [TGT]? fractured and without a legitimate agenda democrats have nothing going for them besides trumpas tweets and making false accusations about the president and those around him [SEP],1,0

[TGT] has accelerated this norm erosion but [TGT] didnat start [TGT]. intensifying polarization driven by an extremist republican party is making constitutional hardball a new norm for party politics. the lessons of history are clear. extreme polarization can wreck even established democracies. america is no exception. as long as americans do not overcome their deepening partisan animosities democracy remains at risk a president trump or no president trump.

[CLS] this in a nutshell is my analysis of president [TGT] ’ s tweets : they are unflinchingly candid and defiant in the face of political correctness. occasionally the tweets ’ wording is clumsy and their timing is awkward. but always trump says what he means. like president ronald reagan trump is a man of a few simple large ideas. we can extrapolate his domestic and foreign policies from his body of relevant tweets : lower taxes and fewer regulations the wall the emasculation of obamacare and the assertion of american military power. however unlike reagan who was witty and self - effacing trump commands the language with cupped hands. he wields superlative adjectives the way a shot - putter heaves an iron ball with mindless vigor rather than precision. any tweet trump sends out that doesn ’ t have to do with less intrusive government or illegal immigration or international challenges to american interests we may frankly regard as twitter trash. these extraneous tweets serve only to feed the media ’ s frenzy. the same news media which breezily allowed former president barack obama ’ s scandals and blunders to escape their notice now turn their focus on trump ’ s every misstep like searchlights on a wart. obama ’ s political locution was unnervingly suave. to my ears however obama sounded like a passive - aggressive firebrand. whenever he opened his mouth i heard : “ you suck. ” for eight years i endured his lectures and insinuated insults. forgive me for relishing the left ’ s hysteria over trump ’ s slangy pronouncements. hillary clinton lost because she lacked obama ’ s smooth rhetorical obfuscation. her speechifying exuded the boredom and tension of snarled traffic. compared to her at the debates trump was positively whitman - esque. i don ’ t even use a smartphone. i can gauge the effect of trump ’ s tweets only from the pained uproar of the media. how tweet it is — says trump to them — to be loathed by you!

[TGT] is attempting to signal to supporters of the joint comprehensive plan of action ( jcpoa ) the nuclear agreement us president barack obama negotiated with iran that [TGT] is willing to blow up that deal because he sees it as disadvantageous to the united states while also signaling that the president is willing to not blow up the deal provided that he gets his way on other elements of a counter - iran strategy. at the same time [TGT] is attempting to signal to opponents of the jcpoa that there is a way to address the weaknesses in the deal without blowing [TGT] up provided that those opponents give the president some relief by revising the iran nuclear agreement review act ( inara ) to remove the 90 - day certification requirement. in its most basic form this is a boat - rocking strategy. [TGT] is threatening to do something that most people do not want [TGT] to do a including apparently most people on the president's own team a in order to get others to do things that they have hitherto been unwilling to do. ( by the way this strategy is not unlike the strategy that the [TGT] team is currently pursuing on north korea a only there the primary target of the boat - rocking is the chinese government and here the primary target is european allies and democrats on capitol hill. ) and in practice obama was hesitant to challenge iran on those other activities lest doing so would disrupt the diplomatic gains of the jcpoa whereas [TGT] has received little support from our allies when [TGT] showed greater willingness to confront iran. when combined with the unwillingness of our allies to do more to push iran on non - nuclear issues the 90 - day requirement that the president publicly certify that iran is abiding by the jcpoa agreement was a pill too bitter for [TGT] to swallow more than twice. [TGT] is betting that congress will not do so because in the interval the white house is hoping to persuade our allies to get tougher on iran on the non - nuclear issues. in exchange for that greater allied cooperation [TGT] hopes it will be able to persuade congress to amend the inara and remove the 90 - day certification thus buying more time for other lines of pressure to come to bear on iran. the foregoing is based on the advanced reporting on what [TGT] is planning to do along with a heavy dose of rational actor rationalization ( "" what is the [SEP]",0,1
[CLS] san francisco ( reuters ) - california's attorney general plans to file a lawsuit on wednesday challenging [TGT]'s plan to construct a wall along the border with mexico the state ag's office said adding to the obstacles facing a key [TGT] campaign promise. [TGT] has insisted mexico would pay for building the wall which experts said could cost about $ 22 billion and take more than three years to complete. with mexico refusing to pay [TGT] has said since taking office in january that the wall will initially need us funding but that he will find a way to make mexico ultimately pay for it. democratic attorneys general including california's xavier becerra have sued the [TGT] administration on a range of issues. the border wall lawsuit set to be filed on wednesday will allege that trump's wall violates federal environmental standards as well as constitutional provisions regarding the separation of powers and states'rights a becerra spokesperson said. last month the [TGT] administration said it had selected four construction companies to build concrete prototypes for a wall which will be will be 30 feet ( 9 meters ) tall and about 30 feet wide and will be tested in san diego.

"" wouldn't you love to see one of these nfl owners when somebody disrespects our flag to say'get that son of a bitch off the field right now. he is fired. he's fired'"" trump told the assembly of mostly white supporters to loud applause. without calling names trump was clearly talking about african - american athletes who chose to take a knee in protest over police brutality and other racial inequities rather than stand for the national anthem during nfl games. he intended for blacks to take his comments personally. and they did. in the same speech laced with references to the second amendment and his proposed mexican border wall trump made another statement that was just as divisive. the way trump sees it african - americans and other minorities are messing everything up for white americans. now they want to ruin football. in trump's view blacks make it harder for law enforcement when they complain about police brutality. the country would be much better off in his opinion if "" those people "" ( the term he used in his speech ) just went somewhere and shut up. black athletes often become a part of america's elite once they hit it big. african - americans and whites embrace them for their prowess on the football field or basketball court. america turns them into heroes role models and examples of success. trump seems to think these athletes should be grateful for the respect they are given. trump also seems to imply that athletes should be grateful to nfl owners for giving them a chance to make something of themselves. it is the kind of mentality that masters held regarding blacks on their plantations — a method that was used to keep slaves subservient. trump chooses to ignore the fact that if it were not for these black athletes there would be no nfl or nba. franchise owners however know the real deal. that's why they are locking arms with their players.

"" in the weeks ahead our administration will advance its plan to open the united states embassy in jerusalem a and that united states embassy will open before the end of next year "" pence said. when [TGT] last month appeared before cameras and announced the u. s. was recognizing jerusalem as israel's capital and beginning to prepare for a new embassy in the city pence stood behind [TGT] a in more ways than one. as a devout christian and an ardent supporter of israel pence was one of the biggest advocates for the move as the [TGT] administration debated the decision. but instead of allowing the parties to move on it has led to a crisis in u. s. - palestinian relations a the lowest point in the trump administration's months of shuttle diplomacy and attempts to restart the peace process. palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas says the u. s. sided with israel and that he will not participate in peace negotiations led by the united states. [TGT] tweeted that if the palestinians were not prepared to negotiate the u. s. should cut funding for them. indeed the administration subsequently cut $ 65 million in funds to a u. n. agency for palestinian refugees but said it was meant to encourage reform in the agency not as punishment. in a rambling and fiery speech abbas directed a colloquial arabic phrase at trump a literally "" may your house be destroyed "" a that is often used casually but was widely criticized by israeli leaders and seen as brash rhetoric directed at a foreign leader. meeting with european union foreign envoys in brussels abbas said the palestinians would participate in peace talks only if they were held with the involvement of other countries not just the united states. abbas sees european countries as more favorable than [TGT] to the palestinians. opposition lawmakers stood and applauded but not netanyahu. many members of his right - wing coalition reject a two - state solution. since trump's election many in the israeli government have called for annexing parts of the israeli - occupied west bank where israeli settlements are located and where palestinians want to establish a state. israel has refrained from such an annexation since capturing the territory 50 years ago fearing international and american backlash but many lawmakers believe the time to do it is now a with a sympathetic president trump in the white house.

[CLS] ( cnn ) last year president [TGT]'s victory defied conventional wisdom and brought to a close a campaign that pitted the two most unpopular presidential candidates in the history of modern polling against one another. a year out from the election trump remains unpopular as do the democrats the republicans and congress. trump has reached lows in his approval rating unseen by any president at this point in their presidency. modern presidents wavered between 50 and 80 % approval in the first 10 months of their presidencies in nearly every case. trump's approval is in a category of its own however. trump sees the same dynamic as expected. and like the republican party overall trump's support leans old male and white. much has been made specifically about his support from the white working class. the latest cnn poll showed trump continues to perform slightly better among white people without college degrees than whites with them. 61 % 60 % american voters say [TGT] is “ a strong person. ” american voters say [TGT] does not “ share their values. ” 56 % 42 % american voters say [TGT] is not “ honest. ” americans believe [TGT] will be one of the worst presidents in us history. source : quinnipiac university october 5 – 10 2017. 1 482 voters nationwide with a margin of sampling error of ±3 % pts. ; marist university poll october 15 – 17 2017. 1 093 adults with a margin of sampling error of ±3 % pts ; cnn politics. trump consistently earns high marks for strength. an october poll from quinnipiac university is just one of the latest to enforce the trend. however trump has also consistently fared poorly on a number of other leadership qualities. the same poll enforced these trends as well showing the public largely regards him as untrustworthy and not sharing their values. additionally an october poll from marist university showed most people did not expect trump to be the stellar president he promised. a plurality said he would go down as one of the worst in history. after trump fired fbi director james comey the department of justice appointed former fbi director robert mueller to lead a special counsel investigation into all things russia and any matters he should see fit to pursue in the course of that probe. near the end of october mueller's team indicted two former trump campaign hands and revealed a guilty plea from a former trump adviser. the investigation continues and an august poll showed many anticipated trump would seek to put his thumb on the scale and cnn's latest polling showed most disapproved of how he's handling the probe.

[CLS] as my colleague vann newkirk ii wrote in september the commission was adogged by allegations that its true purpose is not eliminating voter fraud but instigating voter suppression. a critics of the commission pointed to the fact that its appointees included longtime advocates of restrictive voting laws such as kansas secretary of state kris kobach to argue that the panel merely existed to provide pretext for further voting restrictions. the genesis of the commission was the presidentas baseless claim that amillionsa of illegal votes had cost him the popular - vote victory in the 2016 election when his democratic rival hillary clinton won about three million more votes. neither the commission nor the president ever turned up evidence supporting [TGT] as claim but the panel became a source of controversy as civil - liberties and voting - rights groups accused the body of violating privacy protections and transparency obligations. the panel faced a number of lawsuits from groups like the american civil liberties union the brennan center the electronic privacy information center and even a democratic member of the commission itself. civil - rights groups celebrated the end of the commission. dale ho of the aclu voting rights project called the panel aa sham from the start. a vanita gupta formerly the head of the obama - era civil - rights division and head of the leadership conference on civil and human rights said the commission was a political ploy to provide cover for the presidentas wild and unfounded claims of mass voter fraud and to lay the foundation to purge eligible voters from the rolls. a kristen clarke head of the lawyeras committee for civil rights one of the groups that sued the commission said the panel was alaunched with the singular purpose of laying the groundwork to promote voter suppression policies on a national scale a adding that its disbanding was aa victory for those who are concerned about ensuring access to the ballot box. a rick hasen an election law expert and law professor at university of california irvine wrote that the commissionas demise was due in part to athe light of publicity and the intense scrutiny the press and many of us gave the commission. if they were going to provide a predicate for voter suppression they were not going to be able to do it without a fight. a there are lingering questions even now that the commission is disbanded. for one while many states resisted sending their votersa personal information to the commission others did raising the question of what happens to the data that was collected. a the commission may no longer exist but what happened to the information? a asked sherrilyn ifill head of the naacp legal defense fund one of the groups [SEP],2,1
