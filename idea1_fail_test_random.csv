[CLS] [TGT] financial statement reveals a hemorrhaging fountain of red ink with no path to profitability [TGT] trumpeted [TGT] q4 / 2017 financial statements as evidence of [TGT]'s progress towards ceo dara khosrowshahi's goal of profitability and ipo by 2019 ; [TGT] argued that despite losing $ 4. 5 billion in 2017 [TGT] cust - cutting in the final quarter of the year was proof that [TGT] would eventually go from losing money on each ride to actually earning money. but a closer examination of the figures shows that nothing of the sort is going on. [TGT]'s cost - cutting came mostly in the form of cuts to driver compensation taking $ 2. 2 billion out of drivers'pockets meaning that [TGT] drivers are increasingly losing money with every drive ( something that isn't apparent until you factor in the capital costs borne by drivers ). [TGT] drivers can drive for other companies or get other jobs ( that's key to uber's claim that its drivers aren't employees without which [TGT] would be unambiguously doomed ) ; [TGT] rival lyft is happy to go on paying drivers more ( for now ) and drivers have already shown that it's pretty easy to ditch the platform create their own app and pocket 25 % more than [TGT] will pay them. so [TGT]'s already losing drivers and also they lost $ 4. 6 billion - - and to become profitable they'll have to find another $ 4. 6 billion in cost - cutting which is unlikely to come from drivers whom they're actually going to have to start paying more if they want to continue to have cars on the street. for uber to find an additional $ 4. 6b / year in savings there would have to be some indication that their costs were actually going down with scale. they're not. insurance a major cost to [TGT] is rising linearly with revenue. other costs have gone down thanks to deep cuts : operations sales and marketing research and development and general and administration. unless the company starts spending more on these they will not continue to grow and thus will continue to lose billions. what's more [TGT]'s figures are totally untrustworthy. every financial report from [TGT] picks a different set of accounting practices selected to cast [TGT] dismal finances in the best possible light ( and even with that cherry - picking [TGT] is still losing $ 4. 5b / year! ). so things are likely much much worse. all previous releases of [TGT] revenue data were limited to the top - line agross passenger payments [SEP],2,1
[CLS] until this point there was an underlying faith in much of the political world that if [TGT] iiias investigation of russian collusion in the election turned up unmistakably damning material about donald trump republicans in congress would feel obligated by their commitment to the countryas well - being to accept muelleras findings and challenge the president. [ the mounting attacks on mueller are misguided and dangerous ] well it sure seems to be. itas not surprising that trump and those on his payroll want to protect him at all costs. but we learned last week that republicans are deepening their complicity in derailing muelleras investigation and burying the facts. the more mueller imperils trump the more mccarthyite the gop becomes. the apotheosis of republican congressional collusion with trumpas efforts to hang on at all costs came at a hearing of the house judiciary committee. one republican after another attacked mueller and the federal bureau of investigation as if the latter should be placed on a new compendium of subversive organizations. the rationale for this gop assault is that peter strzok an fbi agent involved in the investigation exchanged texts critical of trump and favorable to clinton with an fbi lawyer. somehow mueller got no props for removing strzok from the investigation this summer. because we are inured to extreme partisanship and to the political rightas habit of rejecting inconvenient facts we risk overlooking the profound political crisis that a trumpified republican party could create. and the conflagration may come sooner rather than later as mueller zeroes in on trump and his inner circle.

( joe raedle / getty images ) bannonas response? a judge [TGT] has more honor and integrity in that pinkie finger than your entire family has in its whole dna. a yes he really said that. party loyalty can itas true be honorable if it is about the defense of principles and moore as backers say they are sticking with him to oppose abortion and multiply conservative judges. but these rationales ring hollow given mooreas utterly unconservative claims as a judge that his theological predilections overrode the law and his lies about not profiting from his private charity which suggest he is a charlatan exploiting the beliefs of his supporters for his own purposes. both moore and president trump play on the feelings of marginalization experienced by many cultural conservatives. it would be salutary for such voters to declare that there are limits to how much they will allow themselves to be used by politicians whose words and deeds are so often at odds. if moore is not the limiting case there are no limits. moore as promoters including bannon want to convince alabama republicans that since a jones triumph will be taken as a rebuke to trump they have an obligation to fall into line. but the long - term harm to the gop from a moore victory will be far greater than from one lost senate seat.

[CLS] the [TGT] presidency is itself a provocation. [TGT] is a billionaire a reality tv star a congenital liar who is seemingly addicted to a social media app which [TGT] uses to live - tweet [TGT] responses to a morning television show. the public is often bombarded with the phenomenon of [TGT] inner thoughts being pushed to mobile devices not only by twitter but by pretty much every news outlet on the planet. and with good reason. [TGT] controls an arsenal of nuclear weapons authorizes covert action and has vast surveillance capacities at [TGT] fingertips. [TGT] also brought with [TGT] to washington a team of radical ideologues and outsiders — people like steve bannon stephen miller and sebastian gorka. his attorney general jeff sessions has a long history of racism including — according to his former associates — using the n - word and “ joking ” about joining the ku klux klan. [TGT] has given encouragement to white supremacists and neo - nazis at times through his public statements and at others by what he doesn ’ t say. and [TGT] is the master of the dog whistle. see for example [TGT] saying there are good people on both sides in the aftermath of the horrible white supremacist violence in charlotte. or how trump and his acolytes constantly talk about violence in chicago as a substitute for the racist perspective they only want thinly veiled. he calls black athletes “ sons of bitches ” says the mass shooter in las vegas was “ probably smart ” and constantly portrays undocumented immigrants as a collective group of gang members rapists and murderers. there is no doubt that the way [TGT] talks and tweets the people [TGT] has chosen to surround [TGT] with and the policies [TGT] has announced or implemented are all evidence that this is a dangerous administration. but how dangerous relative to past u. s. presidents? if you talk to many democrats on capitol hill [TGT] is the most dangerous president in u. s. history. [TGT] has also given rise to a new alliance of discredited hawkish neocons and msnbc hosts and analysts. former directors of the cia nsa and dni have all clamored to condemn [TGT] and assure the public that these heroic spy agencies are protecting the country from the madman inside 1600 pennsylvania avenue. george w. bush and dick cheney implemented a global torture network began shipping people snatched from across the globe to guantanamo prison invaded iraq and afghanistan and conducted mass surveillance operations against americans. the list of horrible presidents who caused unimaginable death and destruction across the globe is vast. none of this absolves [TGT] one bit [SEP],1,2
[CLS] all this makes it easy to forget that one potential candidate is missing : the onetime presumptive favorite victoria reggie kennedy. she has definitively ruled out any temporary appointment and there is nothing to suggest that she wants to run either. that is too bad because she is the natural inheritor of the [TGT] mantle. for such a long - awaited race the assumed stampede of candidates has been slow to materialize. [TGT] is out. marty meehan is out. mike capuano is on the fence. no one is ever going to replace [TGT]. the flood of obituaries reminded us eloquently that he devoted decades to becoming the master of the senate. he often said that he came into his own as a senator only upon the death of his presidential ambitions. we can forget the notion that we are electing someone to fill his shoes because that is impossible.

[TGT] received money from people or businesses that had an interest in using [TGT] legislative powers for their benefit according to the government's case. prosecutors had also accused the former senator of not only failing to disclose conflicts of interest but of also violating the state's ban on gifts worth more than $ 75. [TGT] was convicted last december on two of eight felony counts of theft of honest services mail fraud. jurors failed to reach a verdict on one count and acquitted [TGT] on five counts. [TGT] has appealed the conviction. in july 2008 [TGT] abruptly resigned from the senate position [TGT] had held for 32 years including 14 years as republican leader. the eight - count indictment handed up in january 2009 accused [TGT] of enriching himself through consulting deals with people who had an interest in his legislative decision - making. on may 6 [TGT] was sentenced to two years in federal prison but allowed to remain free on [TGT] own recognizance until the supreme court's ruling thursday.

[CLS] one of the biggest wild cards in the 2018 battle for the u. s. senate may not be so wild after all. [TGT] federal corruption trial ended in a hung jury last week. that leaves [TGT] free to run for reelection in 2018. menendez could be retried but many legal experts believe that a conviction is unlikely. without that conviction and absent major action following a senate ethics investigation menendez is a clear favorite in 2018. the case against an easy menendez victory in the general election comes down to his current popularity a or lack thereof. an october quinnipiac university survey put his approval rating at just 31 percent among new jersey voters ; 49 percent disapproved. whether or not menendez remains this unpopular following the lack of a conviction remains unclear. but any senator who has an approval rating of 31 percent should be in some danger of losing. yet the republicans who have emerged to challenge menendez arenat likely to strike much fear in his campaign. none has more than about $ 4 000 on - hand according to the federal election commission. menendez has nearly $ 4 million. ousting an incumbent senator a even an unpopular one a with no money is a¦ difficult. thatas especially true for a republican in blue new jersey given how expensive new york and philadelphia media markets are. that menendez is an incumbent also helps. the advantage of incumbency can vary by election and on average itas gotten smaller in recent years. but incumbents still usually do better than youad expect given a stateas fundamentals. in 2012 for example menendez won reelection by nearly 20 percentage points. he did so when the national political environment was much less friendly to democrats than it looks to be in 2018 a democrats won the national house vote by 1 percentage point in 2012. that is menendez did about 6 points better than youad expect a democrat to do in new jersey in 2012. menendez probably wonat win by 30 points. the scandal will almost certainly hurt him. itas just unlikely to hurt him by enough to give a republican that good of a chance. a paper from nicholas chad long estimated that senate incumbents from 1974 to 2008 involved in scandals lost an average of 12. 6 percentage points off their reelection margin. in such a scenario menendez would still be forecasted to win by about 20 percentage points. obviously thereas a margin of error surrounding this estimate but it would take a pretty big error for menendez to lose given these fundamentals. so menendez scandal notwithstanding would be a general election favorite.
